## Description ##

### WP Last Modified Info: the Ultimate WordPress Last Modified plugin ###

Most WordPress themes usually show the date when a post was last published. This is fine for most blogs and static websites. However, WordPress is also used by websites where old articles are regularly updated. This last updated date and time is important information for those publications. The most common example is news websites. They often update old stories to show new developments, add corrections, or media files. If they only added the published date, then their users would miss those updates.

Many popular blogs and websites don’t show any date on their articles. This is a bad practice and you should never remove dates from your blog posts.
